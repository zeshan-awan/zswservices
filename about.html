      <h2>Time Choice Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        TCS Time Choice is a fulfilment service that enables customers to select
        the date and time when they want their orders to be received.
        Deliveries are usually made within the threshold of one hour—no later
        than 30 minutes after the customer’s chosen time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bundling the Time Choice option with their chosen shipment mode allows
        customers to carry on with their routines as planned, without putting
        aside the whole day for receiving an important delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The promised times depend upon the intended destination within the network.
